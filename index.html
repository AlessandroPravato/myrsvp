              for example our tables manager, or guest registration.<br><br>

              Before sending out your invites you need to have some invitees! You have 2 options:<br>
              <b>a)</b> You can create a <b>private invitees list</b> adding people manually or from different sources.
              For each invitee you can choose how to send your invitation which will have a personal message and an unique link<br>
              <b>b)</b> Or you can generate a <b>public link</b> to be shared anywhere you want. Anyone with the link can reply!<br><br>

              Once you're done, it is time to blast out your invitations or to publish your public link!

              Sit back and watch your guest list grow as you start receiving all the RSVPs.<br><br>
              You can <b>filter</b> guests based on their attendance status, relationship or preference and
              you can <b>edit</b> their details and even their RSVP anytime, if needed.<br><br>
              What if you already know that someone is coming and you don't need to send out the invitation,
              or if a person is not really tech savy?<br>
              You can <b>add attendees manually</b> and RSVP on their behalf!

              No worries it's <b>easy to manage last minute changes</b> during registration and to rearrange seats accordingly.<br><br>
              And you don't have to do it alone! The guest registration list is synced across yours and your co-host devices,

              Invitees from your private invitees list are special and will be greeted with their name ;)<br>

              If you required guest registration, guests will also receive a registration link with their RSVP confirmation email.
              With that, they can simply confirm their presence by tapping "I'm here" when they reach your venue!<br>
              This is synched with your registration list and you'll just need to check their phone for the confirmation.<br><br>
              You and your co-hosts will always be able to register guests manually, of course.

              Guests can be busy too! You can add an event to MyRSVP app using the code displayed on the event landing page.<br>
              Remember that for private events that code is personal for each invitee!<br>
              When you add an event to the app you'll be notified of any changes to the event details, and receive an RSVP reminder before the dealine ;)
